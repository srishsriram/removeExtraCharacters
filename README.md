The purpose is to clean strings by removing characters outside a desired set.

## Overview

This project contains a single C source file (`removeExtraCharacters.c`) that implements functionality to remove unwanted characters from strings. The cleaned output retains only permitted characters (e.g. letters, digits, whitespace, or others — depending on how it’s configured).

There is no existing documentation or description in the repository. (As shown on the GitHub page: no description, no topics.) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Features

- Simple, standalone C implementation.  
- Reads input (e.g. from `stdin` or via function parameters) and outputs a cleaned string.  
- Configurable character filters.  
- Minimal dependency (standard C library only).

## Usage

You include or compile the C source and call the function (or run the binary) with input. The program removes disallowed characters.

A typical command-line usage might be:

```bash
./removeExtraCharacters < input.txt > cleaned.txt
